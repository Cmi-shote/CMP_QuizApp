# Quiz App (Kotlin Multiplatform Project)

A cross-platform **Quiz App** built with **Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP)** — supporting **Android** and **iOS** from a single shared codebase.  
Originally built with XML layouts on Android([Github](https://github.com/Cmi-shote/Quiz_App)), this new version leverages **Compose Multiplatform** to deliver a modern, scalable, and unified experience.

## API
This app consumes data from the REST Countries API using Ktor for network requests.
Endpoint used:
[flags](https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all?fields=name,flags).
The response provides each country’s name and flag.
A helper function randomly selects 10 countries and generates single-choice options for questions like:
“Which country does this flag belong to?”
